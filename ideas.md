# Ideas

1. Create a website that gives information: my poetry-recipe website, built with Jekyll. Screen-reader accessible.

2. Create an interactive fiction game. "Choose your own adventure" game made with Python, like [*Adventure*] (http://rickadams.org/adventure/) but way shorter and (probably) sillier.
